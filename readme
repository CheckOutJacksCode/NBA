# NBA MVP App

Node/Express API and scripts with front end utiziling the NBA's public api. Users can access any stat for any player within the 
5 years of available data provided by the NBA database. Users also can access the 'deep stats' for any player for any of the given years,
which are custom, weighted, accumulative stats.

## Running the app locally

Install project dependencies using `npm install`
You can then run the project with `npm start`

Once the app is running locally, you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Options for extension
- Try to find a way to make the queries faster; maybe by starting to copy everything to my own database so I don't have to jump through so many hoops to get the correct data.
